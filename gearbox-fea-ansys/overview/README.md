## Project Overview

This project investigates the structural behaviour of an aluminium gearbox
under combined thermal and mechanical loading using finite element analysis
in ANSYS Workbench.

The analysis workflow includes thermal–structural coupling, modal and harmonic
response, linear buckling, non-linear elastoplastic behaviour, and sub-modelling
of critical stress regions.

This folder provides a high-level visual overview of the system geometry,
analysis scope, and loading concepts. Detailed modelling decisions, mesh
verification, and results are documented in the corresponding folders.
